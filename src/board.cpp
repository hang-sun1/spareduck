/* 
    Creates a 2d array that determines a piece's possible moves along a rank.
    Indexed by the square (0-7) along the rank as well as the rank's occupancy.
    The occupancy is a 6 bit number that determines which squares are occupied
    along the rank. For example 0b111111 states that the middle six squres are occupied in
    the rank. Only six bits are used as the 2 squares at the ends of the ranks
    can be ignored as they cannot block movement to further squares.
